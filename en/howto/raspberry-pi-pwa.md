# Use your CentralBoard PWA on your Raspberry Pi
Each dashboard on CentralBoard is a progressive web app and can be used on each device that can manage Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

## What is a PWA?
A progressive web app is a website that can run as a standalone app on your device. For CentralBoard this means you don't need to waste time to set up an HTML-Page to call your dashboard. Just install the PWA and you are ready.

The most dashboard services force you to create an HTML-Page with a useless iframe workaround to display your dashboard on your raspberry pi or recommend you to use a third-person app to display your board.
## Download your dashboard app
### Step 1.
Open your dashboard list and choose your dashboard that you want to install.

### Step 2.
Click on the "Private Dashboard Url*"-Button to open your board in a new tab. 

### Step 3.
Each browser has different ways to install a PWA, for raspberry pi we recommend to use chromium.

### Step 4.
If you open your dashboard in chromium, you need to install the PWA by open "Settings" (IMAGE) and clicking on "Install CentralBoard...".

### Step 5.
Accept to install CentralBoard on your raspberry pi by pressing "Install".

Your board is now installed on your raspberry pi and can be opened without open chromium.
