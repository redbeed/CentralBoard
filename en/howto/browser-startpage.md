# Use as browser startpage
_Did you know that you can use each CentralBoard as your browser startpage?_

## Prepare your dashboard
We recommend using the "Widescreen" aspect ratio for your dashboard to get the best experience and try to use different font sizes for several widgets to get a better overview. 
Tip: Use larger font sizes for more relevant widgets.

## Set your dashboard as your browser Startpage
Each of your Dashboard has a unique URL. This URL will be set as your browser startpage

### Step 1.
Open your [dashboard list](https://centralboard.app/en/user/dashboard), and choose your board that is already configured, by pressing on "Edit".

### Step 2.
Click on the "Private Dashboard Url*"-Button to open your board in a new tab. 

### Step 3.
Copy your private URL from the address field in your browser.

### Step 4.
Set the URL as your startpage.
Open the link for your Browser to get a detailed view of "How to set up a Startpage".
